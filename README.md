# Double Dice Simulator

Welcome to the Double Dice Simulator! This simple Python program, built with Tkinter, allows you to simulate the roll of two dice. Each die is represented by a random image, providing a visual representation of the dice values. The program utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to display the dice images.

- Python (version 3.x)
- Tkinter
- PIL (Pillow)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tk pillow
```

   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python double_dice_simulator.py
